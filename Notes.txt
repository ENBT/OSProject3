Some notes about this VM and Nachos.

1. The DDD debugger has been installed if you wish to try it.
2. The student user is in the wheel group so it can use sudo to perform administrative functions...Please use this power with the respect it deserves!
3. The 'nachos_package' folder on the Desktop should be used as a fresh/original copy of all needed files.  Work from the /home/student/Development folder instead.
